💃 Effmass now has a command line interface  
💃 Effmass now supports FHI-Aims, Castep and ASE  
⚠️ The `Data` class has now been renamed `DataVasp`. You may need to update your scripts!

`effmass` is a Python 3 package for calculating various definitions of effective mass from the electronic bandstructure of a semiconducting material. It consists of a core class that calculates the effective mass and other associated properties of selected bandstructure segments. The module also contains functions for locating bandstructure extrema and plotting approximations to the dispersion.

If you use `effmass` for your published research [please cite effmass](##citing-`effmass`).

## Release 2.0.0

--> `effmass` now interfaces with more codes:
- `effmass` can now read in Castep output data (in addition to Vasp and FHI-aims)
- `effmass` can now work with ASE bandstructure objects

--> `effmass` now includes a command line interface

As a result of these changes, and with view to supporting more DFT codes in the future, the `Data` class has been renamed to `DataVasp`. **On updating to the latest version of effmass you may need to update your scripts / Jupyter Notebook to reflect this change.**

## Features

`effmass` can:

**Read in a bandstructure:**
It is assumed you have used a DFT calculator to walk through a 1D slice of the Brillouin Zone, capturing the maxima and minima of interest. `effmass` uses the Python package [vasppy](https://github.com/bjmorgan/vasppy) for parsing `VASP` output.

**Locate extrema:**
These correspond to the valence band maxima and conduction band minima. Maxima and minima within a certain energy range can also be located.

**Calculate curvature, transport and optical effective masses:**
The curvature (aka inertial) and transport masses are calculated using the derivatives of a fitted polynomial function. The optical effective mass can also be calculated assuming a Kane dispersion.

**Assess the extent of non-parabolicity:**
Parameters of the Kane quasi-linear dispersion are calculated to quantify the extent of non-parabolicity over a given energy range. 

**Calculate the quasi-fermi level for a given carrier concentration:**
Using density-of-states data and assuming no thermal smearing, `effmass` can calculate the energy to which states are occupied. This is a useful approximation to the quasi-Fermi level. *Note: this is only supported for VASP and requires the output file `DOSCAR`.* 

**Plot fits to the dispersion:**
Selected bandstructure segments and approximations to the dispersion (assuming a Kane, quadratic, or higher order fit) can be visualised.

The [command line interface](## Installation) provides basic functionality for calculating parabolic effective masses.
For those who have a basic familiarity with Python there is an API which provides access to more (non-parabolic) effective mass definitions. 

Depending on the functionality and level of approximation you are looking for, 
it may be that one of the packages listed [here](https://effmass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Related%20packages.html) will suit your needs better.

## Supported Codes

`effmass` currently supports `VASP`, `FHI-Aims`, `Castep` and `ASE`. In the near future we hope to play nicely with other codes that interface with the ASE bandstructure class, and pymatgen. We especially welcome contributions that will help make `effmass` available to more researchers.

## Installation

`effmass` is a Python 3 package and requires key packages from the [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org/about.html): SciPy, NumPy and Matplotlib. If you have not installed these packages before, it may be best to install them using your preferred package manager (eg: Homebrew). Note that together they will use >100MB of disk space. `effmass` can then be built using the Python package manager `pip`:

```
pip install effmass
```

To start the command line interface simply type

```
effmass
```

To download and install the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass/releases):
```
cd effmass
python3 setup.py install
```

Or clone the latest development version
```
git clone git@github.com:lucydot/effmass.git
```
and install the same way.
```
cd effmass
python3 setup.py install 
```

## Documentation

An overview of the features of effmass along with example code for Vasp and FHI-aims is contained in a Jupyter notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lucydot/effmass/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb).
Additional examples for the Castep and ASE interface are [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lucydot/effmass/blob/master/tests/Test_Castep_interface.ipynb).
API documentation is [here](https://effmass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Source code is available as a git repository at [https://github.com/lucydot/effmass](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass).

## Publications using `effmass`

A [number of publications](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=12032412581356217625) have used `effmass`.

The [paper](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass/paper) directory contains the Vasp input data (POSCAR), Vasp output data (OUTCAR/PROCAR) and band structures generated for *Impact of nonparabolic electronic band structure on the optical and transport properties of photovoltaic materials*  Phys. Rev. B **99** (8), 085207 - also avaiable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02281.pdf).

## Questions, bug reports, feature requests

Please use the Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass/issues/) for any questions, feature requests or bug reports. Please do not contact the developers via email unless there is a specific reason you do not want the conversation to be public.

## Development

If you would like to contribute please do so via a pull request. All contributors must read and respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In particular, we welcome contributions which would extend `effmass` so that it is able to parse output from other electronic structure codes. 

## Tests

Automated testing of the latest commit happens [here](https://travis-ci.com/lucydot/effmass).

Manual tests can be run using 
```
python3 -m pytest
```

This code has been tested with Python versions 3.6.
