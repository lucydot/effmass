`effmass` is a Python package for calculating various definitions of effective mass from the electronic bandstructure of a semiconducting material. It consists of a core class that calculates the effective mass and other associated properties of selected bandstructure segments. The module also contains functions for locating bandstructure extrema and plotting approximations to the dispersion.

Examples are provided in a Jupyter notebook `here <nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lucydot/effmass/blob/master/paper/notebook.ipynb>`_.
Source code is available as a git repository at `https://github.com/lucydot/effmass <https://github.com/lucydot/effmass>`_.
